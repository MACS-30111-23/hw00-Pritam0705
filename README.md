### Git/Github workflow
**Steps needed to complete homework**
1. Accept the homework on github
2. Clone the homework respository on your local machine by using git clone command on terminal
3. Make changes to the readme file.
4. Add changes to file by running git add filename command on terminal
5. Commit changes to the repository by using git coommit -m"Some commit message" command
6. Finally push the changes to repository by using git push command

Markdown file is really important as it gives the deatils about the repository and its contents. If a repository has a program or conatins any script file, we can mention the details about how to use that file\package on your local machine. This homeworks helped me to learn about how we can add images to the markdown file.
